To make iProlog:

	cd src
	make

This will make everything. Note that xforms and netpbm libraries are needed
for the full installation. If you do not want the GUI and image components,
you can select the build you want by going into each subdirectory and making
only the component you want.

The directories are:

	prolog	- for a vanilla Prolog interpreter
	KBS	- to add frames and RDRs
	ML	- for some common machine learning and statistics algorithms
	ILP	- for a refinement rules based ILP learner
	Probot	- a scripting language for conversationa agents
	GUI	- a GUI frame browser
	image	- for some image processing routines
