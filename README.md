# iProlog
Experimental Prolog interpreter with functions, frames, ML, ...

Some form of this interpreter has been in development since the late 1970's, originally called UNSW Prolog.

It is not intended as a high performance Prolog system but as an experimenal platform for trying out things such as:

* a frame representation language
* hybric logic/function programming
* a variety of machine learning algorithms, inclufding ILP.
