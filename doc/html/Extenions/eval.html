Functional Evaluation in iProlog</H1>
iProlog implements a simple form of eager functional evaluation through
an extension of the <B>is</B> built-in predicate. Programmers are allowed
to define their own <B>is</B> clauses. For example:
<UL>
<PRE>: f(X) is X**2+3.
: f(5)?
28</PRE>
</UL>
<I>f</I> is defined as a function on <I>X</I> which returns the value <I>X^2+3.
</I>Not that the iProlog interpreter knows the difference between a function
and a predicate, so to evaluate a function it is only necessary to type
the functional expression and the resulting value is printed on the terminal.

<P>To invoke a function from within a function is easy:
<UL>
<PRE>: g(X) is f(X) * 2.
: g(5)?
56</PRE>
</UL>
To evaluate a function within a clause, use the <B>is </B>predicate:
<UL>
<PRE>: p(X, Y) :- Y is g(X).
: p(5, X)?
X = 56</PRE>
</UL>
Functions are really just a notational convenience, internally, the are
implemented as if they were clauses whose last argument is always the output.
Here is another example:
<UL>
<PRE>conc([], X) is X.
conc([A|B], C) is [A|conc(B, C)].

rev([]) is [].
rev([A|B]) is conc(rev(B), [A]).

rev([1, 2, 3])?
[3, 2, 1]</PRE>
</UL>

<H2>
Semantics</H2>
In general, function definitions have the form:
<UL>
<PRE>F is X :- Conditions.
F is Y :- Conditions.
.....</PRE>
</UL>
The order of execution is:
<OL>
<LI>
The function call is unified with <B><I>F</I></B>in the first clause.</LI>

<LI>
The <B><I>Conditions </I></B>are then processed as the body of a normal
Prolog clause. That is, the conditions should consist of a comma separated
list of Prolog literals. They are <B><I>not </I></B>function calls.</LI>

<LI>
Each clause is implicitly terminated by a cut. Thus, if either the unification
with <B><I>F</I></B> fails or one of the conditions in the body of the
clause fails, processing will move to the next clause. However, once one
clause succeeds, iProlog will not backtrack to any remaining clause.</LI>
</OL>

<H2>
A More Complex Example</H2>
The following example is a simple implementation of Prospector's probabilistic
reasoning. First, we define some rules:
<UL>
<PRE>op(850, xfx, -->)!

rcib --> smir(20, 1).
rcvp --> smir(4, 1).
smir --> hype(300, 0.0001).
hype --> fle(200, 0.0002).</PRE>
</UL>
The rule states that the presence of <I><B>rcib</B> </I>support the hypothesis
that <B><I>smir</I></B> is present with sufficiency 20 and necessity 1.
We need to define some prior probabilities:
<UL>prior(rcib) is 0.5.
<BR>prior(rcvp) is 0.5.
<BR>prior(smir) is 0.03.
<BR>prior(hype) is 0.01.
<BR>prior(fle) is 0.005.</UL>


<P>The posterior probabilities are essentially the inputs:
<UL>
<PRE>posterior(rcib) is 1.
posterior(rcvp) is 1.</PRE>
</UL>


<P>The program for evaluating the probabilities is:
<UL>
<PRE>odds(P) is P / (1 - P).
prob(O) is O / (1 + O).

posterior(Consequent) is prob(M * odds(prior(Consequent))) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Antecedent --> Consequent(LS, LN),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M is odds_multiplier(prior(Antecedent), posterior(Antecedent), LS, LN).

odds_multiplier(Prior, Posterior, LS, LN) is LS * (Posterior - Prior) / (1 - Prior) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior &lt; Posterior.
odds_multiplier(Prior, Posterior, LS, LN) is LN * (Prior - Posterior) / Prior :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior > Posterior.</PRE>
</UL>
The program is called as follows:
<UL>
<PRE>: posterior(fle)?
0.342818</PRE>
</UL>
