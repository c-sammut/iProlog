<A NAME="intro"></A>What are Ripple Down Rules?</H2>
Knowledge acquisition for an expert system is often a continuing process
because new knowledge may come to light or some things that used to be
true are no longer true. This means that an expert system's rule set must
be modified to reflect the new knowledge. A major problem in updating a
rule set is to ensure that any modifications leave the rule set consistent.
That is, we don't want changes to break already working rules.

<P><I>Ripple down rules </I>were devised by Paul Compton to make it easier
to maintain a knowledge base and keep all the rules consistent. We will
use the following formulation of a ripple down rule:
<UL><B>if </B><I>condition </I><B>then </B><I>conclusion </I><B>[because
</B><I>case</I><B>]</B><I> </I><B>except</B>
<UL><B>if </B>....</UL>
<B>else if </B>...</UL>
For example:
<UL>
<PRE>if a and b then c except
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if d then e
else if f and g then h</PRE>
</UL>
This is interpreted as "if a and b are true then we conclude c unless d
is true. In that case we conclude e. Here are the outputs of the RDR under
different conditions:
<UL>
<PRE>a and b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; => c
a and b and d => e
a and f and g => h</PRE>
</UL>
Notice that an RDR can always be rewritten as an ordinary <B>if-then-else</B>
statement. The rule above would be:
<UL>
<PRE>if a and b then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if d then e
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else c
else if f and g then h</PRE>
</UL>
We use the exception conditions instead of the normal if-then-else form
because this will make it easier for us to update rules.
<H2>
Building RDR's</H2>
Ripple down rules are built interactively. Initially an RDR consists of
a <I>default </I>rule, such as:
<UL>
<PRE>if true then normal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule 0</PRE>
</UL>
This simply says that no matter what, the expert system will always draw
the conclusion normal. If this were a problem in medical diagnosis, this
rule would work most of the time because most people are normal!

<P>Now suppose that a person comes to the doctor with symptoms <I>a </I>and
<I>b</I> and the doctor concludes that the patient has disease <I>c</I>.
The RDR would conclude that this person is normal. To correct this, we
add an exception rule:
<UL>
<PRE>if true then normal except&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if a and b then c</PRE>
</UL>
This rule now works for this patient since the RDR would conclude that
the person is normal except when the symptoms <I>a </I>and <I>b </I>are
present.

<P>Now suppose another patient with disease <I>h</I> comes along. He as
symptoms <I>f</I> and <I>g</I>. Because there is no rule to cover these
conditions, we still get a diagnosis of <I>normal</I>. This is because
<I>true</I> is always true, so in the absence of any other rules, <I>normal</I>
is the conclusion. How do we fix this? We add a new <I>else</I> part:
<UL>
<PRE>if true then normal except&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if a and b then c
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if f and g then h</PRE>
</UL>
This RDR now works for the new patient. Now suppose another patient comes
to the doctor. This patient has symptoms <I>a, b</I> and <I>d</I>. The
doctor concludes that the patient has disease <I>e</I>, but the RDR concludes
<I>c</I> because of <I>a</I> and <I>b</I>. To fix this problem, we add
another exception rule:
<UL>
<PRE>if true then normal except&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if a and b then c except
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if d then e
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if f and g then h</PRE>
</UL>
This process is repeated for each case that is seen.

<P>How do we know where to add a new rule? Here is the algorithm:
<UL>
<LI>
if a rule fires, but produces an incorrect conclusion, we add an <I>except</I>
branch.</LI>


<P>For example, <B>rule 0</B>, above fires, but produces the wrong conclusion
so an <I>except</I> branch is added. Similarly, in <B>rule 2</B>, the <I>a
and b</I> condition succeeds when given the example <I>a and b and d</I>.
It should not so we add the exception condition.
<LI>
if a rule fails to fire when it should, an <I>else</I> branch is added.</LI>


<P>For example, in <B>rule 1</B> above, the <I>true</I> condition succeeds
and then we test <I>a and b</I>. This fails so we add an <I>else</I> branch
to handle the new case.</UL>

<H2>
Using Case Differences to Build Conditions</H2>
How do we decide which conditions to add to a new rule? We would like to
chose the conditions so that the new rule is as general as possible so
that new cases can be diagnosed correctly. The interactive RDR methodology
requires an expert to tell the system what conditions to use. However,
the expert can get some help from the system.

<P>An RDR system keeps track of which cases caused a rule to be created.
Here is <B>rule 2 </B>above, rewritten with the associated cases:
<UL>
<PRE>if true then normal because [] except
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if a and b then c because [a, b]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if f and g then h because [f, g]</PRE>
</UL>
Now let's see what happens when we get case [a, b, d]. Initially it is
classified as <I>d</I>, which is incorrect. Now what is the difference
between the original case [a, b] and [a, b, d]? The new case has the additional
condition <I>d</I>. So if we want to distinguish the two cases, we just
look to see if <I>d</I> is present. Thus the new rule is:
<UL>
<PRE>if true then normal because [] except
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if a and b then c because [a, b]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if d then e because [a, b, d]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if f and g then h because [f, g]</PRE>
</UL>
Suppose that instead of the case [f, g] we had [a, f, g]. The RDR above
would still produce the correct diagnosis, but the cases would be a little
different.
<UL>
<PRE>if true then normal because [] except
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if a and b then c because [a, b]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if d then e because [a, b, d]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if f and g then h because [a, f, g]</PRE>
</UL>
According to this rule, the case [f, g] would be diagnosed as <I>h</I>.
Suppose it should be diagnosed as <I>i</I>. What is the difference between
the cases? The original case has an additional <I>a</I>. Thus the new rule
could be:
<UL>
<PRE>if true then normal because [] except
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if a and b then c because [a, b]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if d then e because [a, b, d]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if f and g then h because [a, f, g] except
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if not a then i because [f, g].</PRE>
</UL>
Thus, we can make a difference list of conditions from the old and new
case like this:
<UL>
<LI>
if the new case has any conditions not in the old case, add those extra
conditions to the difference list.</LI>

<LI>
if the old case has any conditions not in the new case, add the <I>negation</I>
of those conditions to the difference list.</LI>
</UL>
These differences can then be presented to the expert to select the best
ones.

<P><B><I>Note:</I></B> when attributes are numeric, we may have to do something
else. For example, if case 1 has age 20 and case 2 has age 40, we might
pick the mid point and build a condition age > 30.
