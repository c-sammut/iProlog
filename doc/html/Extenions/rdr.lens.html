<h1>An Example of Coding RDR's in iProlog</h1>

<h2>Describing the problem</h2>

<p>This example is about building a set of rules to determine if someone
should wear contact lens and if so, if the lens should be hard or soft.</p>

<p>The most convenient way of using RDR's in <b>iProlog</b> is to use them in
conjunction with <a
href="/home/claude/iprolog/Doc/html/Frames/Frames.html">frames</a>. So the
first thing we do is define a generic frame to describe the type of object we
are dealing with.</p>
<pre>patient ako object with
        age:
                range
                        new value in [young, pre_presbyopic, presbyopic];
        prescription:
                range
                        new value in [myope, hypermetrope];
        astigmatism:
                range
                        new value in [astigmatic, not_astigmatic];
        tear_production:
                range
                        new value in [reduced, normal];
        lens:
                range
                        new value in [none, soft, hard]
                if_needed
                        if true then none because case0!</pre>

<p>It is not important to know what<i> presbyopic</i>, etc mean. They are
just the names and optometrist would use describe a person's age, and other
attributes.</p>

<p>Given the values of the other attributes, we want to build an RDR that
will return the correct value for <b><i>lens</i></b>, that is, what is the
appropriate type of contact lens for this person. The RDR routines will
construct a rule that will appear as an <b>if_needed</b> dæmon in the
<b><i>lens </i></b>slot of the generic frame <b><i>patient</i></b>. We
initialise the dæmon by inserting a dummy rule:</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<pre>if true then none because case0</pre>

<p>where case0 is a dummy case, as described below.<br>
</p>
<hr width="100%">

<h2>Example Cases</h2>

<p><a href="lens.cases.pro">Here</a> is a list of all the cases that will be
entered into the RDR system.</p>

<p></p>
<hr width="100%">

<h2>An RDR Session</h2>

<p>We write a simple predicate to manage a session for entering a sequence of
new cases.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<pre>go :-
    value(X, isa, [patient]),
    X \= case0,
    rdr(lens of X),
    print_daemon(patient, lens, if_needed).</pre>

<p>When called as:</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<pre>go?</pre>

<p>This will backtrack through all patient cases, except the dummy
<tt>case0</tt>, calling <b>rdr </b>on the <b><i>lens </i></b>slot. This call
will evaluate <b><i>lens of X</i></b> and ask the user if the result is
correct. If it is, the program will move to the next case. If it is not,
<b>rdr </b>will ask the user for the correct result and then, the system
looks at the differences between the <i>corner stone case</i>, ie. the case
which caused the creation of the rule that fired and the new case. The system
asks if each of the differences is relevant to distinguishing the cases.</p>

<p>Each <i>yes</i> answer causes a condition to be added to a new rule. The
new RDR is printed out when all the differences have been checked.</p>
