<H2>DESCRIPTION </H2>

<UL>
<P>

	The stream corresponding to Stream is closed.

For upward compatibility, this predicate also accepts an atom as its argument.
If there is a single open stream with this atom as its associated file name,
then this stream is closed. If there is more than one stream with the same file
name, then one is selected arbitrarily and closed.
