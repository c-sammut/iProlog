<H2>DESCRIPTION </H2>

<UL>
<P>

	Stream is currently open stream on name Name in mode Mode where
	Mode is either 'read', 'write' or 'append'. None of the arguments
	need be initially instantiated. This predicate is non-determinate
	and can be used to backtrack through all open streams.

	The three reserved streams (user_input, user_output, user_error)
	are ignored.

	A fact of this form is asserted whenever a stream is created
	(by open or process) and retracted whenever a stream is closed.
