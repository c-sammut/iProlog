<UL>
<P>cut - limit backtracking</P>
</UL>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<UL>
<P>!</P>
</UL>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<UL>
<P>The cut symbol, '!', is inserted in aprogram just like a goal, but is
not to be regarded as part of the logic of the program and should be ignored
as far as the declarative semantics is concerned.</P>

<P>When first encountered as a goal, cut succeeds immediately. If backtracking
should later return to the cut, the effect is to fail the &quot;parent
goal&quot;, ie. that goal which matched the head of the clause containing
the cut, and caused the clause to be activated. In other words, the cut
operation commits the system to all choices made since the parent goal
was invoked, and causes other alternatives to be discarded. The goals thus
rendered &quot;determinate&quot; are the parent goal itself, any goals
occurring before the cut in the clause containing the cut, and any subgoals
which were executed during the execution of those preceding goals.</P>

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<UL>
<UL>
<PRE>member(X,[X|L]) :- !.
member(X,[Y|L]) :- member(X,L).</PRE>
</UL>

<P>The only result produced by executing:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>member(X, [a, b, c]) ?</PRE>
</UL>

<P>is</P>

<UL>
<PRE>X = a</PRE>
</UL>

<P>the other two potential solutions being discarded.</P>

<UL>
<PRE>p(S,R) :- q(S,T), !, r(T,R).</PRE>
</UL>

<P>The procedure <B>p </B>only calls <B>r </B>for the first solution produced
by <B>q</B>. Alternative solutions which <B>r</B> might produce are discarded.
