<H2>OPERATORS</H2>
<P>Prolog allows three types of operators: infix, prefix and postfix.
Each operator has a precedence, which is a number from 1 to 1200. The
precedence is used to disambiguate expressions where the structure of
the term is not made explicit through the use of brackets. The
general rule is that the operator with the highest precedence is the
principal functor. So if '+' has a higher precedence than '/', then 
</P>
<PRE>        a + b / c       a + (b / c)</PRE>
<P>
are equivalent. Parentheses are necessary if you want to write: 
</P>
<PRE>        (a + b) / c</PRE>
<P>
If there are two operators in the subexpression which have the same
precedence, the ambiguity must be resolved from the types of the
operators. The possible types for an infix operator are: 
</P>
<PRE>        xfx     xfy     yfx</PRE>
<P>
With an operator of type &quot;xfx&quot;, the two subexpressions
which are the arguments of the operator must be of <I>lower</I>
precedence than the operator itself, unless the subexpression is
explicitly bracketed (which gives it zero precedence). With an
operator of type 'xfy', only the first or left-hand subexpression
must be of lower precedence; the second can be of the <I>same
</I>precedence as the main operator; and vice versa for an operator
of type 'yfx'. 
</P>
<P>For example, if the operators '+' and '-' both have type &quot;yfx&quot;
and are of the same precedence, then the expression: 
</P>
<PRE>        a - b + c</PRE>
<P>
means: 
</P>
<PRE>        (a - b) + c</PRE>
<P>
If the operators had type &quot;XFY&quot; the expression would mean: 
</P>
<PRE>        a - (b + c)</PRE>
<P>
The possible types for a prefixoperator are: 
</P>
<PRE>        fx      fy</PRE>
<P>
and for a postfix operator they are: 
</P>
<PRE>        xf      yf</PRE>
<P>
The meaning of the types should be clear by analogy with those for
infix operators. As an example, if '-' were declared as a prefix
operator of type 'fy', then: 
</P>
<PRE>        - - P</PRE>
<P>
would be permissible. If the type were 'fx',the preceding expression
would not be legal, although: 
</P>
<PRE>        - P</PRE>
<P>
would still be a permissible form. 
</P>
<P>In Prolog, a functor named 'Name' is declared a an operator of
type 'Type' and precedence 'Precedence' by the command: 
</P>
<PRE>        op(Precedence, Type, Name)!</PRE>
<P>
The argument name can also be a list of names of operators of the
same type and precedence. 
</P>
<P>It is possible to have more than one operator of the same name, so
long different kinds, ie. infix, prefix or postfix. An operator of
any kind may be redefined by a new declaration of the same kind. This
applies equally to operators which are provided as standard in
Prolog, namely: 
</P>
<PRE>    op(1200, xfx, :-)!
    op(1200, fx, [:-])!
    op(1200, xf, [?, !])!
    op(1100, xfy, ['|', ';'])!
    op(1050, xfy, -&gt;)!
    op(1000, xfy, (,))!
    op(700,  xfx, [=, \=, ==, @&lt;. @=&lt;. @&gt;, @&gt;=, is, =:=, =\=, &lt;, &gt;, =&lt; &lt;=, &gt;=])!
    op(700,  fx, [load, unload, trace, notrace, spy, nospy])!
    op(500,  yfx, [+, -])!
    op(500,  fx, [+, -])!
    op(400,  yfx, [*, /, //, mod, div])!
    op(200,  xfx, [**, ^])!</PRE>
<P>
Note that the arguments of a compound term written in standard syntax
must be expressions of precedence <I>below </I>1000. Thus it is
necessary to bracket the expression 'P :- Q' in: 
</P>
<PRE>        assert((P :- Q))</PRE>
<P>
Note carefully the following syntax restrictions, which serve to
remove potential ambiguity associated with prefix operators. 
</P>
<P>If a prefix operator is written without an argument, as an
ordinary atom, the atom is treated as an expression of the same
precedence as the prefix operator, and must therefore be bracketed
where necessary. Thus the brackets are necessary in: 
</P>
<PRE>        X = (-)</PRE>
