<H2>DESCRIPTION </H2>

<UL>
<P>

	Select blocks for at most timeout milli seconds until one of the input
	streams contained in List are ready for reading.The stream, closest
	to the front of the list, that has been found to be ready is then
	unified with Ready_stream. If no stream was ready, the call fails.
	To block indefinately timeout may be set equal to -1.
	Note that this predicate avoids busy waiting.

	(Unfortunately this is not available on Sys V Unix)
