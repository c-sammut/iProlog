Syntax of Terms</H1>
All data in Prolog are expressed as terms. A term is either a <A HREF="#Constants">constant</A>,
a <A HREF="#Variables">variable </A>or a <A HREF="#Compound Terms">compound
term</A>, including <A HREF="#Lists">lists</A>.
<H2>
<A NAME="White Space"></A>White Space</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
White space consists of blanks, tabs and newline characters.</LI>

<LI>
White space can be placed anywhere before or after a term, operator, bracket,
comma, etc.</LI>

<LI>
White space breaks an atom or integer.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
<A NAME="Comments"></A>Comments</H2>
Comments are also considered white space since they are ignored as part
of the program text. There are two kinds of comments:
<UL>
<LI>
A'%' character indicates that everything following it on the line should
be ignored.</LI>

<LI>
C style comments /* ... */ which can span several lines</LI>
</UL>
Comments cannot be nested.
<H2>
<A NAME="Constants"></A>Constants</H2>
Constants include integers, floating point numbers and atoms such as:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fred&nbsp;&nbsp; prolog&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;=&nbsp; 'Hello there'&nbsp;&nbsp; []</PRE>
The symbol for an atom can be any sequence of characters. Quotes should
be used if there is a possibility of confusion with other symbols (such
as variables, integers).
<H2>
<A NAME="Variables"></A>Variables</H2>
All variables must begin with a capital letter or '_', e.g..
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G001
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _RESULT</PRE>
If a variable is only needed once, it does not need a name Instead it may
be written as an 'anonymous' variable indicated by a single underline character:
'_'

<P>A variable stands for some definite but unidentified object. Unlike
other programming languages, a variable in Prolog is <I>not </I>a storage
location. It is just name given to some value.
<H2>
<A NAME="Compound Terms"></A>Compound Terms</H2>
Data structures in Prolog are built from compound terms. A compound term
consists of a function name (also called the principal functor) and a sequence
of one or more arguments. A compound term also has an "arity" i.e. the
number of arguments. For example the compound term whose name is "point
and which has an arity of 3, with arguments X, Y and Z, is written as:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; point(X, Y, Z)</PRE>
Compound terms can be pictured as trees. For example, the term:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s(np(john), vp(v(likes), np(mary)))</PRE>
would be pictured as the structure:
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="man1.gif" BORDER=1 HEIGHT=158 WIDTH=192></CENTER>


<P>For convenience, some compound terms can be written using operators.
For example, the following notation
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X + Y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (P | Q)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X &lt; Y +&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P;</PRE>
is used instead of:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +(X, Y)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |(P, Q)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;(X, +(Y, X))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;(P)</PRE>
Operators are described in more detail <A HREF="operators.html">elsewhere</A>.
<H2>
<A NAME="Lists"></A>Lists</H2>
An important class of data structures are the lists. A list is either the
atom:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; []</PRE>
representing the empty list, or is a compound term with two arguments which
are the head and tail of the list. A list of the first three natural numbers
could be written as:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; list(1, list(2, list(3, [])))</PRE>
but this can be very cumbersome. Instead we use the special notation:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [1, 2, 3]</PRE>
When the tail of the list is a variable, we use the following notation:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [X | L]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [a, b | L]</PRE>
This says that X is the head of the first list and L is the tail. In the
second list, "a" and "b" are the first two arguments and L is the remainder
of the list.
