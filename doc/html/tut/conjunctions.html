<H2>CONJUNCTIONS OF GOALS </H2>

<P>How do we ask, &quot;Does Jeff teach Fred&quot;? This can be answered
by finding out if Jeff lectures in a subject which fred studies. </P>

<PRE>        lectures(jeff, Subject), studies(fred, Subject)?
</PRE>

<P>This is like saying, &quot;Jeff lectures in course, Subject and Fred
studies (the same) Subject&quot;. <I>Subject</I> is a variable. The question
consists of two <I>goals</I>. To answer this question, Prolog first finds
a course, Subject, for which Jeff is the lecturer and then finds out if
Fred studies the Subject which was just found. </P>

<P>A similar query is: </P>

<PRE>        lectures(ken, Subject), studies(Student, Subject)?
        Subject = 621
        Student = jack

        Subject = 643
        Student = henry
</PRE>

<P>That is: &quot;Which students does Ken teach&quot;? Prolog solves this
problem by proceeding left to right and then <I>backtracking</I>. A good
way of picturing what happens when Prolog tries to find a solution and
backtracks, is to draw tree diagrams like the one on the next page. When
given the initial query, Prolog starts by trying to solve </P>

<PRE>        lectures(ken, Subject)
</PRE>

<P>There are five &quot;lectures&quot; clauses, but only two have &quot;ken&quot;
as their first argument. Prolog chooses the first clause containing a reference
to ken, i.e. <TT>lectures(ken, 621). </TT>With <TT>Subject = 621</TT>,
it then tries to satisfy the next goal, viz, <TT>studies(Student, 621)</TT>.
After the first solution is found, Prolog retraces its steps up the tree
and looks for alternative solutions. It may now go down the branch containing
<TT>lectures(ken, 643) </TT>and then try <TT>studies(Student, 643)</TT>.
