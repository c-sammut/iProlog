LISTS</H2>
A very important type of recursive term is the list. The recursive definition
of a list is: a list may be nil or it may be a term which has a head, which
can be any term, and a tail which is another list. Using standard Prolog
notation, we could define the list as:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is_list(nil).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is_list(list(Head, Tail)) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; list(Tail).</PRE>
A list of numbers [1, 2, 3] would look like:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; list(1, list(2, list(3, nil)))</PRE>
Although this notation is consistent with the way Prolog treats all other
data structures, it can be rather clumsy at times. Because lists are used
so often, most Prolog implementations use the alternative, more convenient
notation, [1, 2, 3]. Internally, Prolog still stores the list as if it
were entered in the prefix form.

<P>To get some idea of how the compact list notation works look at the
following queries to Prolog and the answers the system returns:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [X, Y, Z] = [1, 2, 3]?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X = 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y = 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z = 3</PRE>
This query asks Prolog to match (or unify) the two terms on either side
of the equals sign. If a variable appears in a position corresponding to
an element in the second list then that variable is unified with the element.
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [X | Y] = [1, 2, 3]?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X = 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y = [2, 3]</PRE>
The most common procedure for processing a list is to find the first element,
that is the head of the list, perform an operation on it and then repeat
the process for all the elements remaining in the tail. The head and tail
may be separated by using the vertical bar '|' to indicate that the term
following the bar should unify with the tail of the list. Remember that
the tail is usually also a list.
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [X | Y] = [1]?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X = 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y = []</PRE>
An empty list is written as '<TT>[]</TT>'. The end of a list is indicated
by an empty tail. That is, the tail is <TT>[]</TT>. If necessary, several
elements from the front of the list can be selected before matching the
tail.
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [X, Y | Z] = [fred, jim, jill, mary]?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X = fred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y = jim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z = [jill, mary]</PRE>
In this example there must be at least two elements in the list on the
right in order for the goal to succeed. List elements can be as complex
as desired.
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [X | Y] = [[a, f(e)], [n, m, [2]]]?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X = [ a, f(e)]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y = [[n, m, [2]]]</PRE>
This example shows how to put lists inside lists. The right hand list has
two elements:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [a, f(e)]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [n, m, [2]]</PRE>
Notice that Y is shown with an extra pair of brackets. That is because
Y is the tail of the entire list, <TT>[n, m, [2] </TT>is just one element.

<P>A term is a member of a list if the term is the same as the term which
is the head of the list, or the term is a member of the tail of the list.
In Prolog , this is expressed as:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; member(X, [X | _]).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; member(X, [_ | Y]) :- member(X, Y).</PRE>

<A NAME="Writing Recursive Programs"></A>Writing Recursive Programs</H2>
This simple example illustrates a few rules about writing programs which
deal with recursive data structures:<I></I>

<P><B><I>Only deal with one element at a time!</I></B>

<P>Given the problem of specifying that a term is a member of a list, it
might be tempting to think of the list as one single structure. This leads
you to try and examine groups of elements. Always remember that lists and
all other structures in Prolog are made of of smaller things. First write
programs to deals with the smaller things and then worry about putting
them together. In that spirit, the member program checks that head of the
list before proceeding down the tail.<I></I>

<P><B><I>Believe that the recursive program you are writing has already
been written!</I></B>

<P>The definition of member says that a term is a member of a list if the
term is the same as the head or <I>it is a member of the tail of the list.
</I>In the definition we are already assuming that we know how to find
a member in the tail. This is one of the hardest concepts to get used to
in writing recursive programs. If you work out how to deal with just one
element then you can leave the rest to recursion if you pretend that the
program is already complete.<I></I>

<P><B><I>Write definitions not programs!</I></B>

<P>If you are used to writing programs for conventions languages, the you
are used to giving instructions on how to perform certain operations. In
Prolog, you define relationships between objects and let the system do
its best to construct object which satisfy the given relationship.
