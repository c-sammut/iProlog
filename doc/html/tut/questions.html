<H2>QUESTIONS </H2>

<P>Suppose we want to know if Jeff lectures in course 611. We can ask:
</P>

<PRE>        lectures(jeff, 611)?
        ** yes                  output from Prolog
</PRE>

<P>We will follow the convention that a question is terminated by a question
mark, &quot;?&quot;. Different Prolog implementations use different conventions.
These are discussed in the appendices. To answer this question, Prolog
consults its database to see if this is a known fact. Suppose we ask: </P>

<PRE>        lectures(fred, 611)?
        ** no                   output from Prolog
</PRE>

<P>Since Prolog is unable to find a fact which matches the question, the
answer &quot;no&quot; is printed. This query is said to have <I>failed</I>.
</P>

<P>Go <A HREF="facts.html">here </A>to see the database.</P>
