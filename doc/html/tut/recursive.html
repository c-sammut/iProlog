<H2>RECURSIVE PROGRAMS</H2>
<P>In the library database example we saw how terms in Prolog can be
used to represent objects such as books, library members, loans
records, <I>etc</I>. Some complex terms contained other terms, for
example, <TT>book</TT> contained <TT>name</TT>. The following term
also contains another term , this time it is one similar to itself: 
</P>
<PRE> tree(tree(_, jack, _), jim, tree(_, jill, _))</PRE>
<DL>
	<DT>
	The '_' symbol may be replaced by any other term, we don't care what
	it is. A structure like this could be used to represent a binary
	tree that looks like: 
	</DT>
</DL>

<P>A term which contains another term which has the same principal
functor is said to be <I>recursive</I>. 
</P>
<P>The definition of a binary tree is that it is a structure which is
either empty or it contains a left and right subtree. A non-empty
tree may also contain some data. In Prolog we would express this
definition as: 
</P>
<PRE> is_tree(empty).
 is_tree(tree(Left, Data, Right)) :-
 is_tree(Left),
 some_data(Data),
 is_tree(Right).</PRE>
<P>
The empty tree is represented by the word empty. This is not some
special word known to Prolog, it is just an arbitrary word that we
choose to use by convention. A non-empty tree is represented by a
3-arity term. Two of the arguments are the left and right sub-trees
which are also binary trees. The Data field is any data which we care
to put in the tree. Now let us define the size of tree: 
</P>
<PRE> tree_size(empty, 0).
 tree_size(tree(Left, _, Right), Total_Size) :-
 tree_size(Left, Left_Size),
 tree_size(Right, Right_Size),
 Total_Size is Left_Size + Right_Size + 1.</PRE>
<P>
That is, the size of an empty tree is zero and the size of a
non-empty tree is the size of the left sub-tree plus the size of the
right sub-tree plus one for the current tree node. The data does not
contribute to the total size of the tree. 
</P>
<P>Notice that when there is a recursive relationship between terms
,we write recursive programs to describe these relationships. A
recursive program is one which refers to itself, thus, <TT>tree_size</TT>
contains goals which call <TT>tree_size</TT> recursively.
