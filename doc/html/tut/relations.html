Relations in Prolog</H1>
Prolog programs specify relationships among objects. When we say, "John
owns the book", we are declaring the ownership relationship between two
objects: John and the book. When we ask, "Does John own the book?" we are
trying to find out about a relationship.

<P>Relationships can also be described by rules such as the following,
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two people are sisters if
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are both female and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they have the same parents.</PRE>
This is a rule which allows us to find out about a relationship even if
the relationship isn't explicitly stated as a fact.

<P>Programming in Prolog consists of:
<UL>
<LI>
declaring some facts about object and their relationships;</LI>

<LI>
defining rules about objects and their relationships;</LI>

<LI>
asking questions about objects and their relationships.</LI>
</UL>
