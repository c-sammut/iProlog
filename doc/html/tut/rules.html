<H2>RULES </H2>

<P>The previous question can be restated as a general rule: </P>

<PRE>        One person, Teacher, teaches another person, Student if
                X lectures in a subject, Subject and
                Student studies Subject.
</PRE>

<P>In Prolog this is written as: </P>

<PRE>        teaches(Teacher, Student) :-
                lectures(Teacher, Subject),
                studies(Student, Subject).
</PRE>

<P>This is also called a <I>clause</I>. Facts are <I>unit clauses</I> and
rules are <I>non-unit clauses</I>. &quot;:-&quot; means &quot;if&quot;
or &quot;is implied by&quot;. This symbol is often called the <I>neck</I>
symbol. The left hand side of the neck is called the <I>head</I>. The right
hand side of the neck is called the <I>body</I>. The comma, &quot;,&quot;,
separating the goals is stands for <I>and</I>. </P>

<P>Try this rule out: </P>

<PRE>        more_advanced(Student1, Student2) :-
                year(Student1, Year1),
                year(Student2, Year2),
                Year1 &gt; Year2.</PRE>

<PRE>Note the use of the <I>predefined predicate</I> &quot;&gt;&quot;. </PRE>
