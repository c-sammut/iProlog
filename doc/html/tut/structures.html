<H2>STRUCTURES</H2>
<P>Functional terms can be used to construct complex data structures.
For example, if we want to say that John owns the book <I>The
Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy</I>, this may be expressed as: 
</P>
<UL>
	<P>owns(john, &quot;The Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;).</P>
</UL>
<P>This statement tells us very little about the book. Often we
ascribe to objects a number of attributes. In this case, we would
like to represent a book as having a title and an author. A
structured object such a book can be represented by a functional term
as follows: 
</P>
<UL>
	<PRE>owns(john, book(&quot;The Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, adams)).</PRE>
</UL>
<P>Now the second argument to the predicate shows us more detail.
Adams is avery common name, so to be more accurate we should give the
author's family and given names. 
</P>
<PRE>owns(john, book(&quot;The Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, author(adams,douglas))).</PRE>
<P>
How do we ask, &quot;What books does John own which were written by
someone called &quot;Adams&quot;? 
</P>
<UL>
	<PRE>owns(john, book(Title, author(adams, GivenName))?</PRE>
	<PRE>Title = &quot;The Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;</PRE>
	<PRE>GivenName = douglas</PRE>
</UL>
<P>Notice that in order to find a fact in the database which would
answer the question, Prolog performed a quite complex matching
operation between the structures in the query and those in the clause
head. 
</P>
<P>Here is a more complicated example of the use of structures in
Prolog. It is also out first moderately useful set of Prolog
programs. A database of books in a library contains facts of the form

</P>
<UL>
	<PRE>book(CatalogNumber, Title, author(FamilyName, GivenName)).</PRE>
	<PRE>member(MemberNumber, name(FamilyName, GivenName), Address).</PRE>
	<PRE>loan(CatalogNumber, MemberNumber, BorrowDate, DueDate).</PRE>
</UL>
<P>A member of the library may borrow a book. When this is done, a
&quot;loan&quot; is entered into the database recording the catalogue
number of the book which was borrowed and the number of the member
who borrowed it. The date at which the book was borrowed and the due
date are also recorded. Dates are stored as structures of the form
<TT>date(Year, Month, Day).</TT> For example <TT>date(96, 6, 16)
</TT>represents 16 June 1996. Names and address are all stored as
character strings (i.e. atoms). 
</P>
<P>The first program we write tells us which books a member has
borrowed: 
</P>
<PRE>        has_borrowed(MemberFamilyName, Title, CatalogNumber) : -
                member(MemberNumber, name(MemberFamilyName, _), _),
                loan(CatalogNumber, MemberNumber, _, _),
                book(CatalogNumber, Title, _).</PRE>
<P>
Next we would like to know which books are overdue but before we can
get started on this program we first have to work out how to compare
dates. The following predicate tells us when the first date comes
after the second. 
</P>
<PRE>        later(date(Year, Month, Day1), date(Year, Month, Day2)) :- !,
                Day1 &gt; Day2.
        later(date(Year, Month1, _), date(Year, Month2, _)) :- !,
                Month1 &gt; Month2.
        later(date(Year1, _, _), date(Year2, _, _)) :-
                Year1 &gt; Year2.</PRE>
<P>
Note that the cuts indicate that if Prolog has found a clause head
which matches the goal then there is no need to consider the
following clauses. Also notice that the program uses comparison
operators. These operators can be thought of predicates that have
been predefined in the Prolog system. 
</P>
<PRE>        overdue(DateToday, Title, CatalogNumber, MemberFamilyName) :-
                loan(CatalogNumber, MemberNumber, _, DueDate),
                later(DueDate, DateToday),
                book(CatalogNumber, Title, _),
                member(MemberNumber, name(MemberFamilyName, _), _).</PRE>
<P>
For the final program in this example, let's write a rule which will
help us to determine that date on which a book is due. 
</P>
<PRE>        due_date(date(Year, Month1, Day), date(Year, Month2, Day)) :-
                Month2 is Month1 + 1.</PRE>
<P>
This rule illustrates the use of another arithmetic predefined
predicate, namely, the <I>is </I>operator. <I>Is</I> accepts two
arguments. The right hand argument must be a term which can be
treated as an arithmetic expression. This term is evaluated and then
unified with the left hand argument.
