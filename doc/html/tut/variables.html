<H1>VARIABLES</H1>
<H2>SYNTAX</H2>
<P>Variables are denoted by symbols whose first character is a
capital letter or the character &quot;_&quot;, eg. <I>X</I>, <I>Value</I>,
<I>A</I>, <I>A1</I>, <I>_3</I>, <I>_RESULT</I>.</P>
<P>If a variable is only referred to once, it does not need to be
named and may be written as an &quot;anonymous&quot; variable
indicated by a single underline character, '_'.</P>
<P>A variable should be thought of as standing for some definite but
unidentified object. This is analogous to the use of a pronoun in
natural language. Note that a variable is not simply a writeable
storage location as in most programming languages; rather it is a
local name for some data object. 
</P>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>
<P>Suppose we want to ask, &quot;What course does Jeff teach&quot;?
This could be written as: 
</P>
<PRE>        Is there a subject, X, which Jeff teaches?</PRE>
<P>
Here, X, is a variable which stands for an object which the
questioner does not know about yet. 
</P>
<P>To answer the question, Prolog to find out the value of X, if it
exists. As long as we do not know the value of a variable it is said
to be <I>unbound</I> or <I>uninstantiated</I>. When a value is found,
the variable is said to <I>instantiated</I> or <I>bound</I> to the
value. The name of a variable must begin with a capital letter or an
underscore character, &quot;_&quot;. 
</P>
<P>To ask Prolog to find the course which Jeff teaches, the following
query is entered: 
</P>
<PRE>        lectures(jeff, X)?
        X = 611                 output from Prolog</PRE>
<P>
To ask which course(s) Ken teaches, a similar question may be asked, 
</P>
<PRE>        lectures(ken , X)?
        X = 621
        X = 643</PRE>
<P>
When there is more than one possible answer, Prolog will try to find
all of them.</P>
