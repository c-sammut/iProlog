Case 1: [young, myope, not_astigmatic, reduced]
Is none the correct conclusion (should be none)? y

Case 2: [young, myope, not_astigmatic, normal]
Is none the correct conclusion (should be soft)? n
What is the correct conclusion? soft
Corner stone case is: []
Is young correct? n
Is myope correct? n
Is not_astigmatic correct? y
Is normal correct? y
