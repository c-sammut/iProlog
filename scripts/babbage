		In the mid 1800's, the English mathematician, Charles
		Babbage, designed a general purpose mechanical calculating
		machine that anticipated the principles and structure of
		the modern computer. Do you know why he was never able to
		finish building his Analytical Engine and why we didn't
		have mechanical computers 100 years earlier?

		That's right. The only technology Babbage had available to
		him consisted of wheels, gears and steam power. His
		calculating engines were more complicated than anything
		anyone had yet built.

		Even though Babbage's work was never finished, there were

		So you know that she was the world's first programmer.

	{* {Ada | Lovelace} * | <neg>} ==>
	[
		Lady Lovelace was Charles Babbage's assistant and the
		world's first computer programmer. Her first name was "Ada"
		and now there is a programming language called Ada, in here
		honor.
