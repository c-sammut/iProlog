Subject: Correction to Phone List

Hello Ms Nock,

I hope you're having a really wonderful day.

Anyway, for some bizarre reason, my phone number on the phone list seems
to have been changed recently from 6922 to 6930. I do not know why or who
did this, my phone number is (and remains) 6922.

Would it be possible for you to correct the phone number on the official
phone list? I've had several people tell me that it's only through some
effort that they managed to retrieve my real phone number.

Thanks for your help.

Regards,


Waleed.

I was just on the phone to waleed and he informed that 6930 was no loger
his extention. It's 6922...

I got sladem to change the UDB entry but could we change the other bits
and pieces that might have this ext in em please? like
/usr/local/doc/phones/CSE and whatever database Admin might use?

Cheers
Chris
