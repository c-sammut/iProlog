- Return values from topics called as predicates (the I got ^1, vs I got ^(^1) bug). 
- Retracts at the end of functions cause segfaults. 
- generic frames should be declared as dynamic. 

Consider the following code: 

map(_, [], []). 
map(Function, [X|L], [Function(X)|Rest]) :-
	map(Function, L, Rest). 
 plus1(X) is X + 1.
 map(plus1, [1,2,3], X)? 

The above doesn't work. However: 

map(_, [], []). 
map(Function, [X|L], [Y|Rest]) :-
	Y is Function(X), 
	map(Function, L, Rest). 

doesn't work. 

using a backquote can cause crashes in date scripts. How to ensure lists of
words passed from a #return actually match. 

When calling frame() from another function that provides parameters,
it crashes with a "Trying to ground an unbound variable". This occurs
in interp/make.c.
